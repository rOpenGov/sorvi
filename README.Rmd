# sorvi<a href="https://ropengov.github.io/sorvi/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" /></a>

sorvi package was originally intended for hosting various algorithms for Finnish open goverment data in [R](https://www.r-project.org). After being superseded by later rOpenGov packages that are more specialized in scope (such as geofi, hetu and pxweb), sorvi has now found a new life in hosting various functions that are helpful in rOpenGov package maintenance, authoring and preparing presentations.

Originally rOpenGov/sorvi was a fork of [juusohaapanen/soRvi-dev](https://github.com/juusohaapanen/soRvi-dev) but rOpenGov's sorvi branch has since taken a life of its own. The fork was detached fron juusohaapanen's branch in November 2021.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sorvi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rOpenGov/sorvi")
```

Development version can be also installed using the
[r-universe](https://ropengov.r-universe.dev):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Enable this universe
options(repos = c(
  ropengov = "https://ropengov.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
install.packages("sorvi")
```

There is still a CRAN release version of sorvi and while it passes CRAN checks without problems it contains mostly outdated functions. It is therefore highly recommended to use development version of the package.

## Using the package

Loading the package in R:

```{r example_load, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(sorvi)
```

Get download statistics of eurostat-package, by year:

```{r example_download_stats, eval=TRUE}
df <- cran_downloads(pkgs = "eurostat", sum = "by_year", use.cache = FALSE)
df
```

Get download statistics of various rOpenGov packages over time and draw a chart:

```{r example_visualize, eval=TRUE}
packages <- c("eurostat", "giscoR", "sotkanet", "geofi", "sweidnumbr")
plot <- cran_downloads(pkgs = packages, sum = "total", output = "plot", use.cache = FALSE)
plot
```
