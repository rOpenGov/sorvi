# AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
# 
# BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO

# 
# 1. Definitions
# 
#    1. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
# translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
# phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
# transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that

# performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
# which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the
# Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
# separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
# constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
#    3. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as
# appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

# entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the
# case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play
# in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
# phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds;

# a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or
# a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic
# work.
#    7. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the
# terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
# rights under this License despite a previous violation.
#    8. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public
# recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
# available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
# place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to
# the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the
# Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
#    9. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
# recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance

# 
# 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright
# or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under
# copyright law or other applicable laws.
# 
# 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
# royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
# the Work as stated below:
# 
#    1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
# incorporated in the Collections;
#    2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
# takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.
# For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a
# modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";
#    3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
#    4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
#    5.
# 
#       For the avoidance of doubt:
#          1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
# through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
# collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
#          2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
# any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
# royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
#          3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in
# the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
# society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
# 
# The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
# include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
# formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
# 
# 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
# restrictions:
# 
#    1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of,
# or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
# Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
# recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
# sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties
# with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
# may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
# from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
# the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
# subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
# practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
# Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
# required by Section 4(b), as requested.
#    2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has
# been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
# or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
# Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
# journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
# reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
# reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
# not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the
# case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the
# Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this
# Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
# Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or
# Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
# contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
# of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
# explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
# Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
# permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
#    3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
# Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
# must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
# the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any
# exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
# distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
# reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
# applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
# make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
# 
# 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
# 
# UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
# REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
# WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
# ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
# JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
# 
# 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU
# ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
# LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
# 
# 7. Termination
# 
#    1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
# this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,
# will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
# licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
#    2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
# applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
# different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not
# serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of
# this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
# 
# 8. Miscellaneous
# 
#    1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
# license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
#    2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
# original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
#    3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
# validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to
# this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
# enforceable.
#    4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
# consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
#    5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
# are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be
# bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
# without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
#    6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
# terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
# 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of
# 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect
# in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
# provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
# rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
# rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
# under applicable law.
