# Algorithmic Tools for Open Data in Finland

The sorvi package hosts various functions that are mainly helpful in
rOpenGov package maintenance, package authoring and drawing graphs for
presentations. Additionally it has some functions that do not (yet) have
their own package but are useful in some contexts.
