## Details

Most of the Finnish municipalities were formed after 1865 decree on
municipal governance in the country [Asetus kunnallishallituksesta
maalla
1865](https://fi.wikisource.org/wiki/Asetus_kunnallishallituksesta_maalla_1865)
but the dataset contains some municipalities that were allegedly formed
even before that. There are two instances of "illegal municipalities"
(Mustio and Rutakko) that were not recognized as actual municipalities
but functioned as such in late 1800s and early 1900s.
